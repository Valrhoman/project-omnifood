# Project-Omnifood

Hi! This demo website was the final project in the Udemy course 'Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS' teached by Jonas Schmedtmann. I have written the codes while following Jonas' lectures and demos.

The Omnifood website is a static page for an imaginary company called Omnifood - a food subscription powered by AI. Please enjoy seeing it with the link below. 😃
