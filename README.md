# project-omnifood

Hi! This demo website was the final project in the Udemy course 'Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS' teached by Jonas Schmedtmann. I have written the codes while following Jonas' lectures and demos.

The Omnifood website is a static page for an hypothetical company called Omnifood - a food subscription powered by AI. You may also enjoy seeing it through the link below. ðŸ˜ƒ
